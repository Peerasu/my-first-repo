# Massively Parallel Burrows-Wheeler Alignment for Microbiome Analysis over Plant Genomic Data

# Plant Microbiome Analysis Pipeline
This repository contain the pipeline presented in the paper "Massively Parallel Burrows-Wheeler Alignment for Microbiome Analysis over Plant Genomic Data". In the paper we mainly talk about step 2, sequence alignment, but this repository wil also contain the step 1-3 but not step 4-5 which is a downstream analysis task.
